# GithubApp

![Github Action CI](https://github.com/yash786agg/GithubApp/workflows/Github%20Action%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

A small sample app majorily build to learn and test the performance of latest Koin dependency Injection along side with latest
Kotlin Corooutines for network request and Coil(Kotlin-first image loading library).

## Languages, libraries and tools used

* __[Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin)__
* __[Kotlin Corooutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html)__
* __[Koin](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin)__
* __[Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/getting_started/)__
* __[Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi)__
* __[Android JetPack Paging](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging)__
* __[Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html)__
* __[Mockito](http://site.mockito.org/)__

## Future Roadmap Features

* __MVI Architecture__
* __Koin UnitTest__
* __Room with Koin and Kotlin Corooutines__

### Koin vs Dagger  

Koin  | Dagger
------------- | -------------
Written in Kotlin  | Written in Java
Errors are fired at runtime  | Errors can be found at compile time
Do not use annotations  | Use annotations
Dedicated library to work with ViewModel (Android Jetpack) | Not interaction with ViewModel

### APK Build with Koin dependency Injection

### APK Build with Dagger2 dependency Injection

### Conclusions

Dagger and Koin are great dependency injection frameworks. Dagger has the advantage of being in the market for a longer time 
than Koin. If you're a Kotlin developer, it will be easier to start with Koin instead of Dagger. Although, Dagger has more 
information in blogs, articles, and questions on Stack Overflow. Finally, Koin is a great alternative for small and medium-
sized apps as Dagger is older and more mature framework when it comes to big projects with a distributed team.
